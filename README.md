## Description

To improve the quality and quantity of the webpage, and also optimize the website for the search engine. I refactor the codebase to follows accessibility standards.
By using the semantic HTML element and organizing the CSS properties, the webpage has a consolidated and firm structure.

by completing this task, I got familiar with how to create a clean and logical structure webpage.
